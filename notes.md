The ModelInference class in functioncall.py is designed to handle the process of generating and executing function calls based on natural language queries using a machine learning model. Here's a breakdown of its main functionalities:

1. Initialization (__init__ method):
- Initializes logging and prints ASCII art.
- Sets up a PromptManager for managing chat prompts.
<!-- - Configures model quantization if load_in_4bit is set to "True" using BitsAndBytesConfig. -->
<!-- - Loads a pre-trained causal language model and tokenizer from a specified model_path.
- Configures the tokenizer with specific settings (e.g., padding). -->
- Creates an ollama client to interact with the ollama server located at http://192.168.8.17:8080/v1
- Retrieves and sets a chat template if not already defined in the tokenizer.
2. Running Inference (run_inference method):
- Applies the chat template to the input prompt.
<!-- - Generates tokens using the model and decodes them to form a completion string. -->
3. Generating Function Calls (generate_function_call method):
- Starts with a user query and initializes a chat context.
<!-- - Generates a prompt and runs inference to get a completion. -->
- Generates a prompt and uses ollama client to get a completion.
- Enters a recursive loop to handle multiple rounds of interaction, where it:
- Validates and processes the completion to extract tool calls and messages.
- Executes validated function calls using the execute_function_call method.
- Handles errors and logs appropriate messages.
- Continues the recursion until a maximum depth is reached or no further tool calls are extracted.
4. Processing Completions (process_completion_and_validate method):
- Extracts and validates the assistant's message from the model's completion.
- Validates and extracts tool calls from the assistant's message.
5. Executing Function Calls (execute_function_call method):
- Dynamically invokes functions based on the tool calls extracted from the assistant's messages.
